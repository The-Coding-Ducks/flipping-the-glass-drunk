s&amp;box gamemode in which you fit your lads in the local pub.

When a glass is to be flipped (an empty beer glass, placed upside down on the bar), means that you the drinkee must physically fight the toughest person in the pub/bar. The toughest person is usually everyone in the bar, due to the fact that everyone thinks they are the toughest. - https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Flipping%20the%20Glass
